## Where To Start:

### My **Pinned** Repos are some of my most recent work:

I released [**Creators**](https://github.com/whoisasey/creators), a database for freelancers working in Toronto. This is V 2.0, built on React-Redux, Firebase and Firestore. I started [V1.0](https://github.com/whoisasey/freelance-me) during bootcamp, and applied new knowledge to 2.0!

My most recent Full Stack app - [**Second Life**](https://github.com/whoisasey/locaid_mvc), is a resource for people to find trusted charities to donate their clothes in Toronto. I built it as a part of [Co.Lab](https://www.joincolab.io/).
This app is built with MongoDB, Express, React and Node.

## What I'm Currently Learning:

- Ruby on Rails
- React/Jest & Ruby Testing

## Bootcamp projects

[**Producer Soundboard**](https://github.com/whoisasey/soundboard), interactive soundboard made with soundbytes of Hip-Hop producers. Built with HTML, CSS and jQuery
