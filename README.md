## Where To Start:

### My **Pinned** Repos are some of my most recent work:

[**Second Life 2.0 - WIP**](https://github.com/whoisasey/secondlife) is the second iteration of my previous app below. This one is built on Ruby on Rails, hosted on Heroku, and uses a PostgresQL database hosted on AWS.

[**Second Life 1.0**](https://github.com/whoisasey/locaid_mvc), is a resource for people to find trusted charities to donate their clothes in Toronto. I built it as a part of [Co.Lab](https://www.joincolab.io/).
This app is built with MongoDB, Express, React and Node.

I released [**Creators**](https://github.com/whoisasey/creators), a database for freelancers working in Toronto. This is V 2.0, built on React-Redux, Firebase and Firestore. I started [V1.0](https://github.com/whoisasey/freelance-me) during bootcamp, and applied new knowledge to 2.0!
